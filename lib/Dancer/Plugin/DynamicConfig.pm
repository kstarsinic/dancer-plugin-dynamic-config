=head1 NAME

Dancer::Plugin::DynamicConfig

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your Dancer config.yml:

  plugins:
    DynamicConfig:
        active_sessions: "active_sessions.json"
        contacts:
          path: "etc/contact_info.json"
          rewrite_class: "ContactInfoRewriter"

In your Dancer application:

  use Dancer::Plugin::DynamicConfig;

  my $sessions = dynamic_config('active_sessions');
  my $contacts = dynamic_config('contacts');

  if (not $sessions->{$session_id}) {
    redirect $login_page;
    return;
  }

  my $user_id = $request->cookies->{user_id};
  if ($contacts->{$user_id}{is_platinum_user}) {
    $allow_platinum_features = 1;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Dancer::Plugin::DynamicConfig> provides a simple and efficient means to
read and decode the contents of a file which might change while your Dancer
application is running.

In your Dancer configuration, you declare a "tag" for the file, a path to the
file, and an (optional) rewrite_class. You can then call C<dynamic_config()>,
passing in your tag, and you will receive back a data structure that
represents the contents of the file on disk. C<dynamic_config()> will cache
the data, and only re-read it when the file's mtime has changed.

=head2 The rewrite_class

This class, if provided, must implement one class method, C<rewrite()>, which
takes the decoded data structure represented by the file's contents.
C<rewrite()> may then return any data structure it likes, and this structure
will be passed back as the return value of C<dynamic_config()>.

=head2 Filetypes

Currently, B<Dancer::Plugin::DynamicConfig> only supports JSON files, and requires
that the filename end in C<".json">. Generalizing this behavior is on the short
list of coming improvements.

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item reinitialize

Forces a cache flush and re-read of the Dancer configuration and all dynamic_config files.

=head1 NOTES

This plugin uses C<Time::HiRes::stat()> to detect the mtimes of your
configuration files. Timestamp resolution is limited by not only your
operating system, but also the filesystem you are accessing. In
particular, Mac OS X HFS will usually have a timestamp resolution of
one second. On such filesystems, if the file is updated, e.g., twice
in one second, there is a potential race condition in which you will
cache the results of the first update and not realize that there has
been a second update.
